            <h1>Monitoring and Coordination</h1>
            <p>The activities under these three programs housed at Program Implementation Unit (PIU) require constant monitoring of progress initiatives on behalf of the departments. PIU acts as a monitoring and coordinating agency for the implementing agencies. The Program Implementation Unit coordinates key program activities set under the ambit of Ease of Doing Business Reform Agenda, Jobs and Competitiveness Program and Strengthening Markets for Agriculture and Rural Transformation. The objective is to ensure that all departments meet the set targets and deadlines set for the year. For this purpose, monitoring of the activities to be implemented by departments is done through a robust electronic dashboard. Moreover, the program monitoring reports as per agreed arrangements are also submitted to the World Bank regularly. Additionally, the PIU acts as a one stop shop for the development partners. The PIU also acts as Secretariat for the technical committees and program steering committees notified under different programs.</p>
